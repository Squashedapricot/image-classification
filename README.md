## Image Classification: Classify Landscapes with a CNN

In this project we build and train a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to classify images of different landscapes. The model will learn to distinguish between six categories: buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seascapes, and streets.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:** This will download the project files to your computer.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use your terminal to move to the folder where the project files are saved.
3. **Install dependencies:** Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary libraries the project uses.
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Open the project in a user-friendly interface by running `jupyter-notebook` in your terminal.

### Results

1. **Training Accuracy of model:** Approx 94%
2. **Training loss of model:** 0.18
3. **Test Accuracy of model:** Approx 76%
4. **Test loss of model:** 0.74
